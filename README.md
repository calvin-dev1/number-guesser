#  Number Guesser Game

A simple command-line number guessing game written in Python.

The computer selects a random number between 1 and 100, and you try to guess it. After each guess, the program tells you whether your guess was too high or too low, and tracks how many attempts it takes you to win.

---

## How It Works

- The secret number is chosen at random.
- You can guess as many times as you'd like.
- The game gives feedback: **"Too high"**, **"Too low"**, or **"Correct!"**
- You can type `exit` anytime to quit.

---

##  How to Run

Make sure you have Python 3 installed, then run:

```bash
python3 number_guesser.py
